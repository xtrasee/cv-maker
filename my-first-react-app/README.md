React+Vite application where users can input their information to seamlessly generate a resume.



## Tech Stack

- React JS
- Vite
- CSS



## Features

- Synchronize user inputs to instantaneously generate a resume.
- Completely responsive.

## Process

This was my first React+Vite application so everything was new to me. I have been following The Odin Project's Front End Web Developer roadmap and this was my attempt for the first project.

It was quite intimidating at first but I was able to familiarize myself with the structure and organization of the applications.

I also referenced other coder's project application solutions to see how their codes differ and what features they included.




## Lessons Learned

- Structure of React applications.
- Learned how to and when to import certain files.
- Explored other package installations to improve the applications design.
- Learned how to deploy React/Vite app through Vercel.

## Improvements

- The design could be much better.
- A feature where users can download the created resume would be a great addition.
